- Finance analyzer
- This console app can record your expences and incomes and show you statistics about them
  - jdbc driver and slf4j api are used to create and connect to database
  - I had troubles with installation of jdbc and slf4j and declarization of classpaths
    It would be great to add feature of delition records and showing them by month and category.
- No need to download anything additional, visit https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc for information
  about driver and api. You need to add them to development environment (I did it via Visual Studio Code UI)
  Also change path to where you want the db to be created (delete url if wherever from you are runnig the programm)
- Run main file (FinantialAnalyzer.java)
